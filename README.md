# ruBERT model for text classification task
## Map:
1. For usage example run <code>how_to_use.ipynb</code> with your path vars.
2. For model's weights go to <code>weights/rubert_model</code>. The following directory contains <code>.safetensors</code> from Hugging Face HUB + fine-tuned <code>.pt</code> weights.
3. For model's tokenizer go to <code>weights/tokenizer</code>.

P.S. The model was fine-tuned on private dataset, that facilitaties text from web pages(primarly Russian language).
